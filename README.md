### What is TypeScript, and how is it different from JavaScript?
Typescript is a typed language that's a superset of JavsScript. It understands all of JavaScript's syntax. It has ability to report errors when the types don't match.
TypeScript uses compile time type checking. Which means it checks types before running code, not while running code where JavaScript cannot. In TypeScript syntax always mention the type where we can infer that what type of data is being passed.
